      <p class="text-muted">St. Francis Xavier College Church is a Catholic church in the Midtown neighborhood of St. Louis, Missouri, United States.

It is a contributing property in the Midtown Historic District on the National Register of Historic Places and it is listed as a City Landmark in St. Louis</p>

    <p class="text-muted">One of the core values here at St Francis Xavier School is the belief that every child deserves access to a high quality education. Once a week the students have the opportunity to visit the school library and take out 2 books. Books are to be returned to school on Wednesday for a Thursday visit to the school library.</p>

    <hr>
    
    <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">Was established in 1982</h5>
    <p class="text-muted">The college stage and auditorium that you see today, has come through a historic process of evolution and gradual transformation. The earliest roots of this stage goes back to the ‘Sans Soucci Theatre’, which was burned down by fire in 1843. But the spirit of Sans Soucci survived the holocaust, and in 1859, when the premises became the property of Belgain Jesuits, who called it St. Xavier’s, theatre came to life again. Our students love The School Auditorium and we hope you do too.</p>

  <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The food options and responsibilities to consider,
    canteens must be more orginized and more efficient than they were in the past. Online menus with photographs of the 
    meals prepered, and detailed descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional 
    choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provied with a School Canteen Account on the 
    school website that keeps thack of the previous meal choices and any dietary requirments they may have. Ordering Online
    by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making it safer and less 
    coplicated for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.</p>

  <h4>Implemented Online Attendance Managment System</h4>
  <img src="attendance.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">
  <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Implemented Online Attendance Managment System: This
    informs parents about their child's/children's activites in the school, instantly. Once a student reaches the school, the
    parents will be informed about the status via text messages, This helps schools keep a record of a students' absenteenisn.
    Students can mark the attendance by logging in,and this is stored in a database, which can later be checked by the Admin.
    The tracker has so much potential that it can identify which students are irregular to their classes and are not ready to
    establish connectivity with the actual concepts of their curriculum's subjects. As soon as you enter a student's Enrollment
    Number or Name, details like availability in classes, number of lectures attended will be displayed and no proxies are 
    possible since the tracker is supported by cloud capibilities. Even the security offered can be so robust and powerful that
    those students who always fool their deans are caught in a shorter span - just after the admin enters login details into
    this tracker. All of this will improve accuracy and trasparency in any of the educational institutions as students and their 
    parents are pre-informed about the real time status of leave requests and absenteenisn confidential manner and at
    reduced costs.</p>
